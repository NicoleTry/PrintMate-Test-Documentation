Test Scenarios for PrintMate

## Purpose
1. Verify complete functionality
2. Verify that the business flows meet the app's requirements
3. Organize work and determine testing effort
4. Determine end-to-end critical app's

I like using test scenarios to organize the features that needed to be tested after a new release. I find that they help me focus on functionalities/tickets that have higher priority. 
I work in a fast paced environment so staying organized but concise is critical for success.

## Real-World Examples: I use these in my work to test
See the following files:

2. Test Scenario Card - Pass.png
3. Test Scenario Card - Fail.png

1. 1. Test Scenario Overview.png
Please see the file named "Test Scenario Overview" to see an example of my scenarios from a high level, I have each release version documented on the column, then each card is a test scenario that needs to be covered during testing.
This particular board covered the testing we needed to do for one of our clients that brings us $1million in revenue in ink sales each year. This is their website: https://pennemblem.com/
I liked to present this to stakeholders so they can quickly see how well the app is performing with each release.

2. Test Scenario Card - Pass.png
I added Pass/Fail labels so I can quickly document the test results. You will see in this file that this scenario passed for this release.

3. Test Scenario Card - Fail.png
When a scenario failed, I would add comments on why the test failed.
